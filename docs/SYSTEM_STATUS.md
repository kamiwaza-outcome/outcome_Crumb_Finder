## 🔧 Known Issues

### 1. Google Sheets Integration
- Sheet ID configured: 1vHu0YgUuKjelv8pMEYQ0Bbcz1Cu_pYIaMhzBDJD_144
- Getting "Unable to parse range" error when checking for duplicates
- May need to manually create the "Opportunities" sheet tab

### 2. RFP Relevance
- Current batch of government RFPs are mostly construction/hardware
- Need to refine search strategy to find more AI/data opportunities
- Consider expanding search window or using more specific keywords

## 📊 Test Results

- Searched for "data processing" opportunities
- Found 6052 total opportunities 
- Evaluated 3 samples:
  1. Bridge construction - Score 2/10 ❌
  2. Air compressor - Score 2/10 ❌  
  3. Weapon system - Score 3/10 ❌

All correctly identified as not matching the company's technology capabilities.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Fix Google Sheets**:
   - Manually create "Opportunities" sheet tab in the spreadsheet
   - Ensure service account has editor access

2. **Improve Search Strategy**:
   - Add more targeted keywords: "data analytics", "AI platform", "machine learning"
   - Search specific agencies known for AI contracts
   - Expand time window to 30-60 days

3. **Schedule Daily Runs**:
   ```bash
   python main.py --schedule
   ```
   Will run daily at 5 PM Eastern

4. **Manual Run**:
   ```bash
   python main.py --run-now
   ```
